  Proximate goals don’t help you, then, unless you have the brains and guts to
  pick one. The one you should pick, and this is what you need brains for, is
  the one that is most pregnant with possibilities. What this means is that you
  end up zig-zagging your way to your ultimate goal, without knowing exactly
  which path you will take.
